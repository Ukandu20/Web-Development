            My Name is Okechi Ukandu. I am a 21 year old aspiring Web developer/Designer. I started taking web development classes earlier this year and they have ever since peaked my interest. <br> My goal is to become an expert web developer then expand my field to data science and DevOps but as for now i will be focusing on my web development skills. <br> My current skill level is all over the place because whilst i  know some advanced parts of web dev. I still have not fully understood the basics to a T. <br> <br> I will be making a lot of smaller projects along the way and then build up to bigger projects such as a portfolio site which will link to all my smaller projects and bigger projects. All projects will be uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/Ukandu20" target="_blank"> my github page</a>  for everyone to access.
